# Multiclass Image-Classification--CNN--Transfer-Learning
### Objective :
This project aims to introduce the basics of computer vision through practical implementation. It involves building a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model for image classification, fine-tuning an existing model to suit the problem statement, and comparing the performance of the models.
### Problem statement : 
Build a model to effectively identify the names of different food items from the uploaded image
### Dataset : 
Food Vision 101  https://storage.googleapis.com/ztm_tf_course/food_vision/10_food_classes_all_data.zip
### Tech Stack : 
- Tensorflow
- CNN
- Transfer Learning and Fine-Tuning of EfficientNet
### Conclusion :
Fine-tuning the EfficientNet model improved the accuracy by 35% compared to building a CNN model from scratch
